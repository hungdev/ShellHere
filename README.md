# ShellHere

ShellHere is an OS X Finder toolbar app that opens the current Finder location in Terminal. This version is a fork of [Etresoft's ShellHere](http://www.etresoft.org/shellhere.html), which was inspired by [Marc Liyanage's OpenTerminalHere script](http://www.entropy.ch/software/applescript/). It's also similar to the popular [Go2Shell](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/go2shell/id445770608?mt=12) but differs from these other implementations in a few key ways:

* opens Finder location in the current Terminal window/tab (if one exists) instead of opening a new window
* beautiful, native-looking icon by [Henrik Nyh](http://henrik.nyh.se/octopress/2007/10/open-terminal-here-and-glob-select-in-leopard-finder/), used with permission under the [CC BY 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)

## Download & Install

Download the disk image [here](https://github.com/downloads/lhagan/ShellHere/ShellHere.dmg) and drag ShellHere to your Applications folder. Then just drag it onto your Finder toolbar.

OS X 10.7 or greater is required. It should work all the way back to 10.5, but you'll have to download the sources and build yourself.
